### Intersection <a name="intersection"></a>

Intersection types are closely related to union types, but they are used very differently. An intersection type combines multiple types into one. This allows you to add together existing types to get a single type that has all the features you need.
For further explanation, please read the official documentation [Typescript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/unions-and-intersections.html).
